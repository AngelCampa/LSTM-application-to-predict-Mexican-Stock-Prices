# LSTM application to predict Mexican Stock Prices

May 2021

This project implements a Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to predict the price of Cemex stock on the Mexican stock exchange from January 2020 to April 2021. The results are compared to a simple RNN. The LSTM has an R2 of 0.72 and RMSE of 0.21 in testing, while the simple RNN has an R2 of 0.75 and RMSE of 0.20, indicating it is the better model for this dataset. The code and methodology are provided.
